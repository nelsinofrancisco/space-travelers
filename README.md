# React & Redux project - Space Travelers' Hub.

For this repository, We've created a project to create a React app using Redux, the main objective is to use the [SpaceX API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3) to consume it, use actions and reducers in React, to understand the concepts about state management, connect React and Redux, connect an existing API via Redux and use the data to display something in the UI, apply React best practices and language style guides in code, and finally add tests using JEST and React Testing Library in the app.

- Open terminal
- Clone this project by the command: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nelsinofrancisco/space-travelers.git
```

- Then go to the main folder using the next command:

```
$ cd space-travelers
```

- Then run the next command to install all dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```


- Finally, run the next command in the terminal to see the web app in your local browser, or also, you can use Live Server in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ npm start
```

### Run tests

- If you want to run our tests, use the next command.

```
$ npm test
```

### Prerequisites

- IDE to edit and run the code (We use Visual Studio Code 🔥).
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) already downloaded.


### Usage

- For anyone who wants to practice React skills.

# Gettin Started ReactJS


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
