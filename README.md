# React & Redux project - Space Travelers' Hub.

For this repository, We've created a project to create a React app using Redux, the main objective is to use the [SpaceX API](https://api.spacexdata.com/v3) to consume it, use actions and reducers in React, to understand the concepts about state management, connect React and Redux, connect an existing API via Redux and use the data to display something in the UI, apply React best practices and language style guides in code, and finally add tests using JEST and React Testing Library in the app.

# Gettin Started ReactJS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
